  <h2>Segway Project Revision and Reflection</h2>
  <p>Though the background of the site is not very exciting being a standard white backdrop it was felt based on the light blue color of the logo that it created a nice contrast to the rest of the page. The work was mostly done on trying to find ways to create a uniform round feeling through most of the page to match with the feel of the segway, and to make it look nice. </p>
  
  <h2>Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement</h2>
  <p>Web developing is obviously held to standards that when new forms of user interface concepts are developed that the user should come to expect comes that almost as way of web development law the interface should be included into the website, or risk of lost traffic may occur when users find that another site has developed a way to implement it better. I feel this is seen in social media over the past few years as their seems to be a focus to add other platforms options into everything to make sure users have all options for spreading their information to customers or friends.</p>
